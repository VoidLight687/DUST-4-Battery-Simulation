The following files show the work that I have done on the DUST-4 Project at Cal Poly Pomona. 
Battery_Model_Guide.mlx describes the process that is used to build the battery model in simulink. Supporting files that this file uses are the 00000016.BIN file, and the VMTest11.slx file.
The VM_sim_test.slx shows the final result of what the Battery_Model_Guide.mlx walks you through.
